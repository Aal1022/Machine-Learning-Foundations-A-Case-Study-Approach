1. Overfitted model

2. The model that best minimizes training error is the one that will perform best for the task of prediction on new data. F

3. Models fits this data the best. Smallest RSS

4. f(x) = w0+w1*x+w2*(x^2) with total linear regression line. w2 will be zero

5. f(x) = w0+w1*x+w2*(x^2) with total linear regression line and go through (0,0). w0 and w2 will be zero

6. f(x) = w0+w1*x+w2*(x^2) with quandrtic curve. None of the w will be zero

7. f(x) = w0+w1*x+w2*(x^2) with quandrtic curve and go through (0,0). w0 will be zero

8. Error curve and model complexity. 
> trainig error contibue keep decreasing
> test error goes down first and then keep up

9. One always prefers to use a model with more features since it better captures the true underlying process. F
