#####How to evaluate the regression line, a cost for given a linear regression line?
* Common cost associated with a specific fit to the data is called the residual sum of squares. 
* The residual is the difference of your prediction and your actual observation.
* Sum over all the difference and try to find the best line, which minimize the residual sum of squares.
* Resulting W and W hat, the set of W hat zero, and W hat one, intercept and slope

######Linear relationship
* Quadratic fit still called linear regression
* 13th order polynomial, overfitting
* Simulating predictions, training set(use as a proxy for predictions) and testing set(hold out)
* Only work well if ther is enough observations
* Training error: sum of residual squares in the training set
* Test error: for hold out test
